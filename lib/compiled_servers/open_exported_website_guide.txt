How to View Your Exported Website

When you export your website, you receive a ZIP file that contains all necessary files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

Important:
Do not open the HTML files directly in your browser (e.g., by double-clicking them). This may cause issues such as broken images, missing styles, or JavaScript errors due to browser security restrictions (CORS).

Instead, run a local server to properly view your site.

Choose the correct server based on your operating system:

Windows

    Double-click server-windows.exe.

    Your browser will open at http://localhost:8080/.

    Inside the "html" folder, you will find your exported pages.

Linux

    Open a terminal in the extracted folder.

    Run the following commands:

chmod +x server-linux
./server-linux

    Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

macOS

    Open Terminal in the extracted folder.

    Run the following commands:

chmod +x server-macos
./server-macos

    Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Folder Structure

exported-site/
├── server-windows.exe
├── server-linux
├── server-macos
└── html/
    ├── index.html
    ├── scripts/
    ├── styles/
    └── images/

Always access your pages through the local server using the /html path. This ensures everything functions as intended.
